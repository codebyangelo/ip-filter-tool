IP Filter Tool for Access Control

Project Name: `ip_filter_tool.py`
A Python-based script that enforces network access control by maintaining an allow-list of authorized IP addresses. Built as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate portfolio to demonstrate applied scripting in real-world data security scenarios.


Purpose

This security tool automates the process of updating an IP address allow-list to ensure only authorized employees have network access to sensitive patient records. It minimizes human error by programmatically removing known unauthorized IP addresses while preserving legitimate ones.


Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Safe file operations using `with open()` (ensures automatic file closure)
- Defensive programming via least privilege access (read/write separation)
- String parsing and list transformations (`.read()`, `.split()`, `.join()`)
- Conditional filtering and controlled list mutation (`for` + `if` + `.remove()`)
- Basic data sanitation (manual detection of malformed/duplicate entriesâ€”optional future upgrade)


How It Works

1. **Reads** a plaintext file named `allow_list.txt` containing IP addresses separated by spaces.
2. **Splits** the string into a Python list of IPs.
3. **Iterates** through the list and removes any IPs found in a predefined `remove_list`.
4. **Rewrites** the sanitized list back into the original file.


Setup and Usage

1. Clone Repository 

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ip-filter-tool.git
cd ip-filter-tool


2. Prepare your `allow_list.txt` file 

Format:

192.168.97.225 192.168.1.10 192.168.158.170 10.0.0.25 999.999.999.999 192.168.201.40
192.168.58.57 172.16.0.5 192.168.0.100


3. Run the Script 

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then:

bash

python ip_filter_tool.py

| File Name          | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ip_filter_tool.py`| Python script implementing the filter logic  |
| `allow_list.txt`   | List of authorized IPs (user-editable)       |
| `README.md`        | Documentation for project and portfolio use  |


Notes

- Duplicate IP entries in `remove_list` require the script to run more than once to fully sanitize. This is a known limitation and can be enhanced using list comprehension or auxiliary filtering logic in future iterations.
- Malformed IPs (e.g., `999.999.999.999`) are not filtered unless explicitly added to the `remove_list`. Format validation is intentionally omitted for this first build to maintain clarity and scope control.


Future Improvements

- Implement duplicate-safe filtering using list comprehension or `filter()`
- Add optional IP format validation using regex or built-in `ipaddress` module
- Modularize logging for audit trails
- Expand to CSV or config-file support for enterprise-scale lists


Certification Context

This project was developed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. It reflects hands-on understanding of basic scripting, secure automation practices, and file-level access control. Demonstrating readiness for real-world infosec tasks.
